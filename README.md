In this project i have tried to :
1. Check correlation among independent variables and how they interact with each other.
2. Use Linear Regression from (Statsmodel library) and explain the results.
3. Test the assumptions of linear regression:
-Multicollinearity check by VIF score
-Mean of residuals
-Linearity of variables (no pattern in residual plot)
-Test for Homoscedasticity
-Normality of residuals
4.Do model evaluation- MAE, RMSE, R2 score, Adjusted R2.
